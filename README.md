Iowa Undergraduate Lifestyle form created for Homework 7 of Digital Product Management

Version 1.0 Created 3-7-2023

Description: This project is a web form for undergraduate students at the University of Iowa to fill out about
their lifestyle on campus.

On my first webform page, I included text boxes for students to enter their first and last name, email address, and gender.
I put a required placeholder for their name, specified with a placeholder that they should include their Iowa email, and 
specified that gender can remain optional. I included radio buttons for the student to pick what grade they are in. This
helps the student understand that a grade is required to be picked. I included a major and minor text box for extra
information, with major being required and minor being optional as not all students have a minor.

On my second webform page, I included two questions with checkboxes asking the student what their favorite bar and
restaurant are. I made sure to show that students can select more than one option next to the question in parenthesis.
I also added an "other" text box that students can input their own options. I added a dropdown box for my next question
on the student's favorite sporting event. I included a placeholder to show that the student must select one of the
dropdown options. The last three questions I included are input questions that students can fill out for more information
about their lifestyles. I provided the student with examples of what they could include for a couple of those questions.
A thank you page is included once the survey is submitted which also brings students back to the starting page.

For the design of my web form, I wanted to keep it simple with a white and black style. I increased the width of the text
boxes to make them fit the screen more. I made my form linear vertically so that it could fit well on a mobile device. I also included some images of Herky and Iowa to indicate that the form is for Iowa students.
